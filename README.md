This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Performance Testing

This project includes Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring:

### Local Performance Testing

1. Build the application:
```bash
yarn build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
yarn start
```

3. In another terminal, run Lighthouse CI:
```bash
# Install dependencies first
yarn install

# Run Lighthouse CI (both mobile and desktop)
yarn lhci

# Mobile-specific test
yarn lhci:mobile

# Desktop-specific test  
yarn lhci:desktop
```

### Available Performance Scripts

- `yarn lhci` - Run Lighthouse CI with default settings
- `yarn lhci:mobile` - Mobile-focused performance testing
- `yarn lhci:desktop` - Desktop-focused performance testing

Performance reports will be generated locally and can be viewed in your terminal.
